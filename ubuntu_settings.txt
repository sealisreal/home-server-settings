# To disable Ubuntu doing anything closing the laptop lid:

# Open the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file in a text editor as root, for example,
sudoedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf

# If HandleLidSwitch is not set to ignore then change it:
# HandleLidSwitch=ignore
# Make sure it's not commented out (it is commented out if it is preceded by the symbol #) or add it if it is missing.
# Restart the systemd daemon (be aware that this will log you off) with this command:
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
# or from 15.04 onwards:
sudo service systemd-logind restart
